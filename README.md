## Basic Example <!-- omit in toc -->

```rust
use shipyard::{Component, IntoIter, View, ViewMut, World};

#[derive(Component)]
struct Health(u32);
#[derive(Component)]
struct Position {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
}

fn in_acid(positions: View<Position>, mut healths: ViewMut<Health>) {
    for (_, health) in (&positions, &mut healths)
        .iter()
        .filter(|(pos, _)| is_in_acid(pos))
    {
        health.0 -= 1;
    }
}

fn is_in_acid(_: &Position) -> bool {
    // it's wet season
    true
}

fn main() {
    let mut world = World::new();

    world.add_entity((Position { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }, Health(1000)));

    world.run(in_acid);
}
```

## Cargo Features

- **parallel** _(default)_ &mdash; enables workload threading and add parallel iterators
- **extended_tuple** &mdash; extends implementations from the default 10 to 32 tuple size at the cost of 4X build time
- **proc** _(default)_ &mdash; re-exports macros from `shipyard_proc`, mainly to derive `Component`
- **serde1** &mdash; adds (de)serialization support with [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde)
- **std** _(default)_ &mdash; lets Shipyard use the standard library
- **thread_local** &mdash; adds methods and types required to work with `!Send` and `!Sync` components
- **tracing** &mdash; reports workload and system execution

## Origin of the name

Assembly lines take input, process it at each step, and output a result. You can have multiple lines working in parallel as long as they don't cross paths.

Shipyards such as the [Venetian Arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Arsenal) are some of the oldest examples of successful, large-scale, industrial assembly lines.\
So successful that it could output a fully-finished ship _every day_.

**Shipyard** is a library you can use to build your own highly-parallel software.

## Motivation

I initially wanted to make an ECS to learn how they work. After a failed attempt and some research, I started working on Shipyard.

[Specs](https://github.com/amethyst/specs) was already well established as the go-to Rust ECS but I thought I could do better and went with [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)'s core data-structure (`SparseSet`) and grouping model. A very flexible combo.
